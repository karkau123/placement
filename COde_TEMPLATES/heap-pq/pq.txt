/*  The most important thing I am learning from this question is that when you have #n elements, making a heap(priority_queue in c++) from n elements by pushing them one by one will be O(N*log(N)) and if we push them all at once then it would be O(N).
If this does'nt amaze you when you come to know this fact for the first time, then nothing will.  */
